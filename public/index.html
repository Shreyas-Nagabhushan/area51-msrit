        <p>
            Welcome you all to the Area 51, a platform for students where they can share their ideas freely, learn exciting and resourceful topics and share their skills without any limits!
        </p>
        <p>
            Presently we have two modes, mask and DM's.
            <p>
                In Mask mode, students can interact with one another without actually revealing their true names i.e with their alias(fake names).
            </p> 
            <p>
                In DM, i.e direct messages, users will have to login or signup with their actual and verified credentials. On doing so they can send or receive messages from a particular user whom they know.
            </p>
        </p>
